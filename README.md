Run the development server:

``` bash

**Scripts**
* dev: Starts the development server using Vite.
* build: Builds the project using TypeScript and Vite.
* lint: Lints the project using ESLint.
* preview: Previews the production build using Vite.
* test: Runs tests using Vitest.

**Technologies Used**
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* TypeScript: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
* Vite: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

* ESLint: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code.
* Vitest: A Vite-native unit test framework.


**Future improvements:**
* Two tests are failing, so would need to be fixed and general better test coverage.
* Some movies have broken posters,so work around it is needed.
